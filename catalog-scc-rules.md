# Governing what software users can install based on provider  
{: #catalog-scc-rules}

As the account owner or administrator, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}} to create config rules to govern what software users can install based on whether it's provided by IBM, third parties, or an open source community. 
{: shortdesc}

After you create a rule, you can monitor for configuration changes by attaching the rule to a scope, such as an account group, specific accounts, or an entire enterprise. You can further investigate noncompliant resources by reviewing your evaluation results.
