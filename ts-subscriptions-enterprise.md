# Why can't I see the enterprise subscriptions?

{: troubleshoot}

When you go to view the Subscriptions page in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} console from a child account, the following message is displayed:
{: tsSymptoms}

> Looks like you don't have permission to view subscription data for this account. Contact your account owner or administrator to request access.

The following message is displayed in the Billing section on your enterprise dashboard:

> Looks like you don't have permission to view this information. Learn more about IAM access.

Access to billing and payment information for future billing periods is restricted to users in the enterprise account. Users in a child account can't access billing and payment information, such as subscriptions, even if they previously had access in the account.
{: tsCauses}

To view or manage billing, you need to be invited to the enterprise account and given access to the Billing service in that account. Contact the account owner to request access.
