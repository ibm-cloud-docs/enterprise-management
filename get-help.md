# Getting help and support
{: #get-help}

If you experience an issue or have questions, you can use the following resources before you open a support case.
{: shortdesc}

* Review the [FAQs about projects](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-project-faqs) and [FAQs about enterprises](/docs/enterprise-management?topic=enterprise-management-enterprise-faqs) in the product documentation.
* Review the troubleshooting documentation for [enterprises](/docs/enterprise-management?topic=enterprise-management-troubleshoot-view-enterprise) and [projects](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-troubleshooting-for-projects) to troubleshoot and resolve common issues.
* Check the status of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform and resources by going to the [Status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status){: external}.
* Review [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud){: external} to see whether other users experienced the same problem. When you ask a question, tag the question with `projects` or `enterprise`, so that it's seen by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} development teams.

If you still can't resolve the problem, you can open a support case. For more information, see [Creating support cases](/docs/enterprise-management?topic=enterprise-management-open-case&interface=ui).
